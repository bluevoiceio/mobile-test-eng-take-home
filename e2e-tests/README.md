###  Code Changes
- Configured WebDriverIO and Appium for both Android and iOS with Page Object based framework.
- Set up Appium Inspector to locate Expo app elements.
- Resolved multiple setup issues, including missing drivers, environment variables, and bundle identifiers.
- Implemented platform-specific handling for element locators and test execution.


### Videos of Test Run-throughs
- Recorded test execution using Appiumâ€™s start_recording_screen API
- It is under test-videos folder
- Demonstrated login flow, element interactions, and automated form handling.

### What I Did & Future Improvements
-Validated automation scripts with real device/simulator execution.
- Handled UI interactions (dismissing save password prompts, closing keyboard).
- Improve test stability with better waits and retry logic.
- Enhance reporting by integrating video logs with test reports.
- Expand test coverage for additional user scenarios.
